### Artificial Intelligence Chatbot

This project implements a basic Artificial Intelligence Chatbot in Java. The chatbot interacts with users through the command line interface, responding to user input based on predefined rules.

### Features:

- Responds to greetings like "hello" and "hi".
- Answers simple questions like "how are you?".
- Expresses gratitude for "thanks" or "thank you".

### Usage:

1. Compile the Java file: `javac Chatbot.java`
2. Run the compiled class file: `java Chatbot`
3. Interact with the chatbot by typing messages and pressing enter.
4. To exit the chatbot, type "exit".

### Sample Interaction:

```
Welcome to the Chatbot! How can I assist you today?
> hello
Hello! How can I help you?
> how are you?
I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to assist you!
> thanks
You're welcome!
> exit
Goodbye! Have a great day.

```
